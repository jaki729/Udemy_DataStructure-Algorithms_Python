# Searching algorithms - Binary Search

# Binary search is a fast search algorithm with run-time complexity of ÎŸ(log n). 
# Space complexity is O(1) because we are using a constant amount of space.
# This search algorithm works on the principle of divide and conquer. 
# For this algorithm to work properly, the data collection should be in the sorted form.
